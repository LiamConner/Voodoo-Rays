<p>Acid house (also simply known as just "acid") is a subgenre of house music developed around the mid-1980s by DJs from Chicago. Voodoo Ray's is a burger bar based in Bath.  The restaurant is inspired by Acid House music from the late 1980s and the early 1990s.  The restaurant was named after the Acid House track 'Voodoo Ray' which was created by A Guy Called Gerald.
